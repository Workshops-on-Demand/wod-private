# Introduction to the Aruba Central API using PyCentral SDK
In this workshop we’ll go through Aruba Central’s API gateway and illustrate how to make an API call to Aruba Central using PyCentral SDK within a Python script. PyCentral SDK is a python library developer specifically for Aruba Central's REST API. We will see how to use in-built modules to make API calls to various GET/POST REST API endpoints.

# Prerequisites
Prior to this lab, users must have a basic understanding of the following:
- [API](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/9)
- [Python3 fundamentals](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)
- Aruba Central

Some helpful resources to getting started with Python concepts can be found in other HPE Hackshack courses!

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
