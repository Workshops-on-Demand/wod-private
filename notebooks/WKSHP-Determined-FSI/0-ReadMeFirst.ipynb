You will take a specific deep learning model and walk through how to interact with the Determined system to train the DL model and visualize the result of the training process. You will experience how Determined makes it easy for ML engineers and data scientists to train deep learning models on one or more GPUs to accelerate training processes, and how it simplifies hyperparameter optimization (HPO) to improve model accuracy and find the best version of a model. \n",

    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
