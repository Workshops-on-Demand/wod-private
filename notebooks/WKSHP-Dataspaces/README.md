# HPE Developer Workshop



# Introduction to Finding the Data You Didn't Know You Needed
In this workshop, you’ll get to see how Project Data Map can help you discover new and meaningful datasets that enhance your model building experience, all whilst keeping track of the datasets you know and love, so next time you don’t have to go digging through old notebooks to find them! You’ll even learn how you can share them with your classmates or trade them for valuable tokens!

## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into TS sessions, we leverage an infrastructure that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

## A quick look at Jupyter Notebook
Jupyter Notebook is an open source solution for interactive documents that are commonly used to hold code for ML/DL models. But it can also be used in many other ways.
A notebook consists of cells. A cell can be either a markdown cell (contains comments, text, images) or a code cell. 


![NotebooksExplanation1](Pictures/NB-explanation1.PNG)

• A notebook is a series of cells

• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)

• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)


![NotebooksExplanation2](Pictures/NB-explanation2.PNG)


• To run a cell use:

    o The Play button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    

> **Note:**  When you see an [*] next to the action, it means your execution step is busy working within the notebook. When you see a digit number, it means the execution of the step is completed.  
    
• Running a markdown cell just renders it

• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button


Enjoy the labs ! :-)

## Handouts
You can freely copy these Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- If you want to Install the Jupyter Notebook application on your own laptop for further tests after this workshop, please start from [here](https://jupyter.org/install) 
- If you want to learn more about Notebooks, a Beginners Guide is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)
