    "\n",
    "[HPE Ezmeral ML Ops](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/solutions/machine-learning-operations.html) is a container-based software platform for organizations that want to operationalize the machine learning (ML) workflow process for delivering ML models to production with ease. HPE Ezmeral ML Ops extends the capabilities of the HPE Ezmeral Container Platform (HPE ECP), enabling the data science teams to run all their ML tasks **in a single platform**, using the underlying HPE Ezmeral Container Platform, Kubernetes and [KubeDirector](https://kubedirector.io/) an open source application from HPE. With HPE Ezmeral ML Ops, data science teams can quickly spin up, &mdash; **on-demand** &mdash;, their development environment, develop and experiment several models with the analytic toolkits of their choice, perform parameters optimization and train their models against enterprise production data. HPE Ezmeral ML Ops is also for Operations teams who are tasked to deploy trained ML models artifacts &mdash; handed over by data scientists &mdash; into production by creating a secure RESTful API service layer to serve the model as a prediction service, so it can be consumed by application clients to draw predictions on new data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, using an example related to predicting taxi ride travel times in NY City, you will be looking at the steps to build an **ML pipeline** that implements a basic end-to-end data science machine learning workflow process and that brings models to production. All of this in a single platform: **HPE Ezmeral ML Ops**.  \n",

    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
