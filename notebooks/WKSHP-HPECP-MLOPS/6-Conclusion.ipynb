    "You have completed the steps to implement a machine learning pipeline that streamlines a basic end-to-end data science machine learning workflow that is seen in the industry today, from data preparation, model development and training to model deployment in production using HPE Ezmeral ML Ops software platform.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You experienced how HPE Ezmeral ML Ops and its integrated collaboration capabilities:\n",
    "\n",
    "* enable data science team, armed with Jupyter Notebook, to focus on rapid experimentation with shared and source controlled notebooks and code scripts without worrying about the underlying infrastructure\n",
    "* reduce the time to deliver models to production so client applications can consume the models easily through a secure RESTful API service\n",
    "* improve models tracking and versioning\n",
    "* enhance collaboration between data science team and operations team.\n",
