    "# HPE GreenLake for private cloud API: Extract the power of the Virtual Machines as a Service (VMaaS) API\n",
    "HPE GreenLake Central is an advanced software-as-a-service platform that provides you with a consistent cloud experience for all your applications and data—on-premises or off-premises. It provides you with insights and controls to manage your hybrid IT estate, complementing your use of public clouds and data centers. HPE GreenLake Central gives you the ability to choose where and how to place your workloads and data, and—through the services you purchase—enables you to monitor security, compliance, capacity, resource utilization, and costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In HPE GreenLake Central, you can do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- View and manage the services available to you in your HPE GreenLake environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Services you use through HPE GreenLake Central appear as cards on the HPE GreenLake Central Dashboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Request and try services that have been offered to you to evaluate through HPE GreenLake Central.\n",
    "\n",
    "- With help from your HPE representative, manage your users and their access to resources in your environment, including access to other tools that are part of the services you purchase or use on a trial basis.\n",

    "# What is the HPE GreenLake for private cloud service?\n",
    "\n",
    "HPE GreenLake for private cloud combines the agility and simplicity of the cloud with the governance and control of an on-premises environment allowing customers to meet business and application requirements for privacy, data location, and latency. This true cloud service delivers an intuitive user experience. It features a self-service dashboard and automated provisioning of VMs, is ready to scale up or scale down on demand, is delivered on a pay-per-use basis, and is operated for the customer. This is a workload-optimized solution, built to meet parameters for flexibility, resiliency, scale, and VM performance. As an on-premises based service, it allows the customer to leverage their existing investments in IT infrastructure toolsets such as VM templates/images, backup solutions, network infrastructure, and more with room to scale. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop we’ll go through some basic usage of the Virtual Machines as a Service API that IT OPS / DEV OPS would use to interact programmatically with their resources. You will see through the basics of the authentication mechanisms. Then you'll get a chance to list a few of these resources available in your tenant. Deploying an instance is a simple but and efficient; you can then perform example one needs to go through too along with all the different actions related to the instance (stop, start, restart, backup...). You will also run some tasks and finally get your hands on a simple blueprint deployment. This workshop does not cover all of the features of the HPE GreenLake VMaaS offering. It simply offers you the possibility to test just a few of them.\n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• A Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To Run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play Button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",

    "Enjoy the labs ! :-)\n",
