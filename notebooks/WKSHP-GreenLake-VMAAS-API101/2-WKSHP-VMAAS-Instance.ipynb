    "\n",
    "## Instances\n",
    "Instances are sets of vms of various types that can be provisioned across the GreenLake for private cloud stack and a wide range of services like MySQL, Redis, ElasticSearch, PostgreSQL, Tomcat, nginx, Confluence, Jenkins, and more. There are a few important concept differentiators between what we call an instance and what amazon calls an instance. In GreenLake an instance can represent many vms that are of a set. For example. If you wanted to spin up a Mongo sharded replicaset, that requires 7 virtual machines. In GreenLake for private cloud we represent this as a singular instance with a specified layout and then represent all the associated services running within that virtual machine. The serverId represents the compute resource it was provisioned onto, (i.e. the virtual machine).\n"

    "# Provisioning concepts\n",
    "HPE GreenLake for private cloud enables provisioning capabilities ranging from individual virtual machines to multi-tier application topologies.\n",
    "\n",
    "HPE GreenLake for private cloud provides provisioning using the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Virtual images\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instance types\n",
    "\n",
    "* Blueprints\n",
    "\n",
    "Using virtual images, instance types, and blueprints, you can provision:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instances\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apps\n",
    "\n",
    "## Virtual images\n",
    "The Virtual Image section of the HPE GreenLake for private cloud dashboard displays a list of synced images from cloud integration. A virtual image is simply a template in VMware vCenter that has been prepared with the right configuration before uploading.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instance types\n",
    "An instance type is derived from a virtual image and can contain variants of the same service. In the following figure, the same Apache service instance type can be used to provision an instance with different versions running on different underlying images.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Instances Types](Pictures/glc_und_std_lib.png) \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Blueprints\n",
    "A blueprint, or application blueprint, allows a user to define an application structure for easy reproducibility and deployment into various environments. Blueprints can be used to mix and match instance types to provision an application dependent on multiple layers, or tiers, of services.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Instances Types](Pictures/glc-blueprint.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Instances\n",
    "An instance is a representation of a resource or service. This service may involve several virtual machines. For example, when you create an instance, a particular option may contain several instance configurations. One of these configurations could be a cluster consisting of seven virtual machines. Rather than representing these directly as seven individual instances, HPE GreenLake for private cloud groups them together into a singular instance of a service that contains multiple virtual machines. This model allows for instance actions that can be performed to expand capacity on an instance (either horizontally or vertically). You can apply this concept to something such as a simple Apache web server in which 10 copies of a web server horizontally are scaled out to handle traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When viewing an instance detail page, you can look at details and statistics specific to a virtual machine. This feature helps simplify the management model for tracking these services.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Apps\n",
    "An app is a collection of instances linked together using application tiers. Tiers enable you to define segregated sections of connectivity between the various elements or instances within an application. Linking instances together in an application may affect instance environments and provide service discovery capabilities for them to cross-connect.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once these instances are all linked together in an application concept, this may affect instance environments and provide service discovery capabilities for them to cross-connect."
