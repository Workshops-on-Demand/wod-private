# Introduction to the pyaoscx v2.0 Aruba Python SDK
This lab is an introduction to Aruba's Python SDK, named pyaoscx v2.0.  Note that this instruction will be specific to the v2.0 or later pyaoscx module, as the class structure and mtehod calls all function differently compared to v1.x

# Prerequisites
Prior to this lab, users must have a basic understanding of Python v3.x as well as fundamentals of class structures and basic programming concepts.
Some helpful resources to getting started with Python concepts can be found in other HPE DEV Hackshack workshops-on-demand, such as:
* [Introduction to Python Programming](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/15)
* [API 101 - API basics and the value they provide](https://hackshack.hpedev.io/workshop/9)



## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A Notebook is a series de cells

• Notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the Notebook)

• Cell can be Markdown or Code (in the selected kernel)

• To Run a cell use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a Code cell runs the code and display the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running it displays a [*] to its left, then when finished, it displays a counter of the number of execution of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)


## Workflow

### Lab 1: Introduction to the pyaoscx v2.0 Aruba Python SDK
Description: In this section, we’ll go through:
  * Setup a Python workflow skeleton to login to the switch
  * Operate a Switch Config using either  Open Granulated Approach or Imperative Factory Approach
  * Add ports to a LAG and tag a VLAN to the lag leveraging Open Granulated Approach or Imperative Factory Approach
