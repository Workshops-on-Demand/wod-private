# HPE Developer Workshop



# Introduction to HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud - Terraform Provider (Challenge)
The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, otherwise known as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), offers many significant benefits. It helps to increase operational agility, simplify management, reduce errors, and save cost. 

In this workshop, we’ll cover how we can combine HPE GreenLake with TerraForm to achieve Infrastructure as Code.

## Handouts
You can freely copy these Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- Install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install) 
- A Beginners Guide is available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)


## Lab flow
HPE Developer Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into TS sessions, we leverage an infrastructure that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A notebook is a series of cells

• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)

• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)

• To run a cell use:

    o The Play button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell just renders it

• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)


## Workflow

### Lab 1: Creating resources with Terraform 
Description: In this lab, we will get familiar with HPE GreenLake security concepts and the Terraform environment. Then, we will use Terraform to create a first VM instance in our HPE GreenLake cloud platform
* [Lab 1](1-WKSHP-Terraform101-CreatingResources.ipynb)

### Lab 2: Desired state management with Terraform
Description: In this lab, we will use Terraform to perform life-cycle management actions on our VM instance
* [Lab 2](2-WKSHP-Terraform101-ManagingResources.ipynb)

### Lab 3: Decommisioning resources
Description: In this lab, we will use Terraform to decommision resources created during this workshop
* [Lab 3](3-WKSHP-Terraform101-DecommisioningResources.ipynb)

### Conclusion: 
* [Conclusion](4-WKSHP-Conclusion.ipynb)
