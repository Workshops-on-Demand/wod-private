    "In this workshop, we covered how to get started with the Terraform provider for HPE GreenLake. We explained how to collect data from the platform and request the creation of a Virtual Machine instance. We then showed you how to manage the lifecycle of a Virtual Machine using Terraform. We applied several changes to the Terraform infrastructure configuration file and observed how the desired state is automatically tracked by Terraform and applied to HPE GreenLake.\n",

You can, for example, get into our [Trial Program](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/greenlake/managed-cloud-controls-trial.html) and test HPE GreenLake for a period of 4 weeks. Another option is to try our Trial Express program. Finally, you can get yourself an account on HPE GreenLake [here](https://auth.hpe.com/signin/register). \n",
