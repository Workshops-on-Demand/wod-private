    "# Introduction to HPE GreenLake for Private Cloud - Terraform Provider (Challenge)\n",
    "The process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable definition files, otherwise known as Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), offers many significant benefits. It helps to increase operational agility, simplify management, reduce errors, and save cost. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we’ll cover how we can combine HPE GreenLake with TerraForm to achieve Infrastructure as Code. \n",

    "## Lab flow\n",
    "{{ BRANDINGWOD }} Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files that always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into TS sessions, we leverage an infrastructure that uses a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides are stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).\n",
    "\n",
    "In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "• A notebook is a series of cells\n",
    "\n",
    "• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)\n",
    "\n",
    "• A cell can be either markdown or code (in the selected kernel)\n",
    "\n",
    "• To run a cell use:\n",
    "\n",
    "    o The Play button at the top\n",
    "    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)\n",
    "    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)\n",
    "    \n",
    "• Running a markdown cell just renders it\n",
    "\n",
    "• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• When a cell is running, it displays an [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell\n",
    "\n",
    "• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button\n",

    "Enjoy the labs ! :-)\n",
