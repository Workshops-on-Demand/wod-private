In this lab, we will start with the same VM configuration created in Lab 1 as shown below. From there, we will show you how to tap into more advanced functionality that’s provided by Terraform and the HPE GreenLake provider:\n",

    "\n",
    "As organizations scale their cloud environments, they often need to define methodologies for organizing resources. For this, they can leverage tags and labels. Tags consist of key/value pairs that make it easier to search for, or filter, your cloud resources based on categories relevant to the organization. Another option is to attach labels, which are simple values, to your VMs in order to keep track of what it’s used for or who it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, let's try adding metadata to the VM using tags and labels. According to the [documentation](https://github.com/HPE/terraform-provider-hpegl/blob/main/docs/resources/vmaas_instance.md), you can add labels by adding the following snippets to our configuration file within the VM resource block: \n",

    "# Using labels\n",
    "labels = [\"hackshack\", \"hpedev\"]\n",
