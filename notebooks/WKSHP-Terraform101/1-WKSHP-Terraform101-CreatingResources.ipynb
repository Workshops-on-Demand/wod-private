    "One of the superpowers of IaC is its repeatability, the fact that you can set something up once and then use the same information in multiple ways. Implementing IaC allows organizations to store configuration files describing the desired infrastructure as a single source of truth. It also allows you to apply the DevOps methodology that’s already in place for application code directly to the infrastructure. For example, configuration files can be stored and managed through GitHub using the same way your DevOps team manages the application code. This concept is often called “Shifting Left”, as you are describing the infrastructure to host an application earlier (left) in the delivery pipeline of the application. This allows for easier and consistent deployments of infrastructure across the complete infrastructure landscape of an organization.\n",

This page on [HPE GreenLake cloud services and ecosystem](https://www.hpe.com/us/en/greenlake/services.html) provides a complete list.

This is exactly what the private cloud service is all about. This service allows customers to point and click to create resources such as virtual machines. It also provides access via a public API, allowing developers to use  an Infrastructure-as-Code type of tool to automate provisioning, for example using Terraform.\n",

    "[Terraform](https://terraform.io) is an open source Infrastructure-as-Code framework originally created by HashiCorp that is written in Go. It uses a declarative language (HashiCorp Configuration Language HCL or JSON more recently) to describe the desired state of the infrastructure in terms of cloud, virtual machines, networks, storage, and many other components. Terraform uses the concept of “providers” to integrate with all major public clouds. Terraform is a so-called idempotent system in the sense that it doesn’t generate any side effects if applied multiple times on an infrastructure already in its desired state. Terraform has gained quite the momentum in the last few years. Its main competition is Ansible, Amazon Cloud Formation, Puppet and Chef.\n"
