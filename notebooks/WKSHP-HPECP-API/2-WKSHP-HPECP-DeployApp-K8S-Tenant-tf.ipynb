Finally, using a K8s API client, such as **kubectl** and the traditional Kubernetes YAML approach, you will deploy a simple cloud native *stateless*, microservices applications, and a non-cloud native distributed *stateful* AI/analytics **KubeDirector** application on **Kubernetes** cluster managed by the HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise.\n",

In the HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise, these applications generally refer to as a distributed, single-node or multi-node application **virtual cluster**. Each application virtual cluster node runs as **a container** in the Kubernetes cluster managed by HPE Ezmeral Runtime Enterprise.\n",

    "- *Stateful application:* A stateful application typically requires persistence of certain mountpoints across application cluster nodes rescheduling, restarts, upgrades, rollbacks. A stateful application can also need persistence of network identity (i.e.: hostname). "
